# Bluetooth Ring Device

A cool startup project I worked at a side endeavour at my internship at Cyberium. It involved using a mobile app to communicate with a ring to monitor various health metrics. It ended up being quite similar to the Oura Ring... but very fun and unique experience otherwise.

I dived into BLE protocols like GATT and created a Flutter application, the full thing including UI, backend for user info, and communicating with the ring as a PoC.
