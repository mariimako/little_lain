# Overview

Steelhead AUV for UBC subbots. Worked on creating IMU driver, autonomous navigation and consolidating OpenCV, navigation, PID controller nodes into a whole system.

We've made it to semi-finals in RoboSub 2025, where over 50 teams from the world come together in California to compete with the underwater AUVs  each team from each university has created in various tasks.

We have also done the best in our team's history this year, and we definitely have a lot less funding than other teams!
