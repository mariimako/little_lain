## About Me

My name is Marius. I'm a student at UBC. My passions are systems security and 'lower'-level programming. I like drumming, music, movies as well. I have an year experience in security and software engineering related internships, and an year of experience as a firmware dev at UBC Subbots, together with teaching and development experience in a undergrad systems course. 

## Experience

### NTT
At NTT, I worked on research and development on system-call based intrusion detection systems for Linux container environments. This included a systematic survey on machine learning and deep learning based anomaly detection that uses system calls, analyzing system call extraction tools, programming and testing new IDS using various features of system calls, creating a pen-testing like environment for testing various intrusion detection systems. I've made a blog post going in detail, albeit NDA makes me refrain from too much detail.


### Cyberium
At Cyberium, I was involved in various blue team operations and  tool development. I analyzed and reported on Nessus, nmap reports, developed security training tools, ISO27001 and SOC 2 certification analysis tools with LLM APISs. I was also further involved later in a startup project on a separate team regarding a bluetooth health device. 

### UBC Subbots
At UBC Subbots, I work on firmware for the Steelhead AUV. I've written drivers in C++ for IMUs to be integrated to ROS2, creating underwater simulation environments in Gazebo for our robot. I also made the script for autonomous navigation for our pre qualification in navigating to and from a gate, putting together computer vision, state estimation and PID nodes. Last year, we made it to semi-finals in RoboSub 2025 and had the best performance in history of our team. 

### Computer Systems Teaching Assistant
I also have worked part-time as a Ugrad teaching assistant for CPSC213. This is a computer systems course. I've gained and leveraged my expertise on this in creating new questions regarding RISC-based assembly translation, coding, thread syncrhonization in C, CPU pipelining, excercises regarding common exploits in C. These were coded in Python, containerized and distributed through a system called Prairelearn. I not only developed questions but autograding test suites to run on student submission, but I would say I spent more time debugging than creating new questions because of the huge variety of submissions of code we get that deal with syncrhonizationand instruction parsing.
