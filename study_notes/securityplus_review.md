Why not, review of it. I have the knowledge already, don't think I will buy it though.

## Security+ Overview
Taken from CompTIA Site.

### General security concepts (12%)
- **Security controls:** comparing technical, preventive, managerial, deterrent, operational, detective, physical, corrective, compensating, and directive controls.
- **Fundamental concepts:** summarizing confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA); non-repudiation; authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA); zero trust; and deception/disruption technology.
- **Change management:** explaining business processes, technical implications, documentation, and version control.
- **Cryptographic solutions:** using public key infrastructure (PKI), encryption, obfuscation, hashing, digital signatures, and blockchain.

### Threats, vulnerabilities, and mitigations (22%)

- **Threat actors and motivations:** comparing nation-states, unskilled attackers, hacktivists, insider threats, organized crime, shadow IT, and motivations like data exfiltration, espionage, and financial gain.
- **Threat vectors and attack surfaces:** explaining message-based, unsecure networks, social engineering, file-based, voice call, supply chain, and vulnerable software vectors.
- **Vulnerabilities:** explaining application, hardware, mobile device, virtualization, operating system (OS)-based, cloud-specific, web-based, and supply chain vulnerabilities.
- **Malicious activity:** analyzing malware attacks, password attacks, application attacks, physical attacks, network attacks, and cryptographic attacks.
- **Mitigation techniques:** using segmentation, access control, configuration enforcement, hardening, isolation, and patching.

### Security architecture (18%)

- **Architecture models:** comparing on-premises, cloud, virtualization, Internet of Things (IoT), industrial control systems (ICS), and infrastructure as code (IaC).
- **Enterprise infrastructure:** applying security principles to infrastructure considerations, control selection, and secure communication/access.
- **Data protection:** comparing data types, securing methods, general considerations, and classifications.
- **Resilience and recovery:** explaining high availability, site considerations, testing, power, platform diversity, backups, and continuity of operations

### Security operations (28%)

- **Computing resources:** applying secure baselines, mobile solutions, hardening, wireless security, application security, sandboxing, and monitoring.
- **Asset management:** explaining acquisition, disposal, assignment, and monitoring/tracking of hardware, software, and data assets.
- **Vulnerability management:** identifying, analyzing, remediating, validating, and reporting vulnerabilities.
- **Alerting and monitoring:** explaining monitoring tools and computing resource activities.
- **Enterprise security:** modifying firewalls, IDS/IPS, DNS filtering, DLP (data loss prevention), NAC (network access control), and EDR/XDR (endpoint/extended detection and response).
- **Identity and access management:**Â implementing provisioning, SSO (single sign-on), MFA (multifactor authentication), and privileged access tools.
- **Automation and orchestration:** explaining automation use cases, scripting benefits, and considerations.
- **Incident response:** implementing processes, training, testing, root cause analysis, threat hunting, and digital forensics.
- **Data sources:** using log data and other sources to support investigations.

### Security program management and oversight (20%)

- **Security governance:** summarizing guidelines, policies, standards, procedures, external considerations, monitoring, governance structures, and roles/responsibilities.
- **Risk management:** explaining risk identification, assessment, analysis, register, tolerance, appetite, strategies, reporting, and business impact analysis (BIA).
- **Third-party risk:** managing vendor assessment, selection, agreements, monitoring, questionnaires, and rules of engagement.
- **Security compliance:** summarizing compliance reporting, consequences of non-compliance, monitoring, and privacy.
- **Audits and assessments:** explaining attestation, internal/external audits, and penetration testing.
- **Security awareness:** implementing phishing training, anomalous behavior recognition, user guidance, reporting, and monitoring.
