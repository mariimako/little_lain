My notes on the certifications I either have gotten or learning. Do not use for actual reliable information but rather for my own motivations.



- **Why it fits:** You’ve already done BLE firmware, ROS2, robotics firmware, and system-level debugging.
    
- **What you’d do:** Secure firmware, analyze IoT/embedded devices, reverse engineer binaries, fuzz IoT protocols, and ensure secure boot / secure comms.
    
- **Industries:** Automotive, robotics, consumer IoT, aerospace, defense.
    
- **Cert/skills to build:** Embedded reverse engineering, ARM exploitation, hardware debuggers (JTAG/SWD), maybe move toward **OSCP or eJPT**, then advanced niche certs (e.g., Offensive IoT Exploitation).

#### 2. **Systems Security / Vulnerability Researcher**

- **Why it fits:** Your telecom internship with syscall monitoring already put you into OS-level/container security. You also know CPU architecture and stack smashing → that’s research-grade systems knowledge.
    
- **What you’d do:** Vulnerability research, exploit development, kernel security, fuzzing, sandboxing, and malware analysis.
    
- **Industries:** Corporate research labs (Intel, Qualcomm, Microsoft Research, Amazon Robotics), security vendors (Trail of Bits, NCC Group), or government labs.
    
- **Cert/skills to build:** Deepen exploit dev, fuzzing, RE (IDA, Ghidra), kernel hacking. **OSCP** is more relevant than Security+.

**Embedded/IoT Security Engineer**  and **Systems Security/Vuln Research**
