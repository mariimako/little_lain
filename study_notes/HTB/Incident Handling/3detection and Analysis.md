Detecting an Incident  (alerts from EDR, SIEM, IDS, firewall)
Good idea to create levels to it
Collect as much infro as possible, like time, who was effected, how detected, impacted systems, malware type, 
Create incident timeline, with hostname, event description, Mimikatz was used etc, data soruce

## Incident Severity & Extent Questions

analyze severity:
- worm like capabiltiies? any remideitation steps avaialble? exploitation requirements? exploitation impact?
## Incident Confidentiality & Communication
, all of the information gathered should be kept on a need-to-know basis

set advancements and expectations, how long it would take and what we need to do (maybe we dont need to know who did it)
